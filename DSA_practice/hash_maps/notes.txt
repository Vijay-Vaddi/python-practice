hash maps, 
maps, 
hashes - Ruby
hash table, 
unordered maps
dictionaries
objects in js

all are same. 

--------

Key is used as an index of where to find the value in memory.
key is sent to a hash function, and this hash function produces the address to loop up in memory. 
hash fucntion decides where(at what address) to put the data in memory. 

-----------

hash fucntion: generates a fixed length output for each/(any?) input.
md5 -is a sample hash fucntion.

same input same output - its called idempotent 

generally hash function used for hash tables handling, converts the key
into hashed output which is then converted nto index space/an address. 

sha256 takes long time to generate hashed output. 

-----------

hash collisions. 

insert, lookup, delete and search all O(1)

#cons of hash table

https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/OpenHash.html

the hash function can sometimes generate same addresses. 
storage [memory address][key][value]. when address is same, previously stored item gets in conflict. 
sometimes linked list is used to overcome this. (other solutions exists)

with limited memory and large input, collision is highly likely. 
theoretically when this happens, it slows down reading and writing. 

O(n/k) -->O(n) (for read and write as well) k-> size of hash table. 

depending on hash function used, lookup can be O(n)

--------------

Hash table in different languages.

depending on the language, the key and val can be any data type. 

can potentially have functions as keys as well.
