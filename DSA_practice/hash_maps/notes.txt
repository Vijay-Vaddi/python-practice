hash maps, 
maps, 
hashes - Ruby
hash table, 
unordered maps
dictionaries
objects in js

all are same. 

--------

Key is used as an index of where to find the value in memory.
key is sent to a hash function, and this hash function produces the address to loop up in memory. 
hash fucntion decides where(at what address) to put the data in memory. 

-----------

hash fucntion: generates a fixed length output for each/(any?) input.
md5 -is a sample hash fucntion.

same input same output - its called idempotent 

generally hash function used for hash tables handling, converts the key
into hashed output which is then converted nto index space/an address. 

sha256 takes long time to generate hashed output. 

-----------

hash collisions. 

insert, lookup, delete and search all O(1)
