Big O and scalability, graph explanation:
---------
Definition:
When we grow bigger in input quantity (elements), how much does the algorithm slow down. 

Elements vs Operations. 
If Elements increases, how many more operations do we have to do? 
This is called algorithmic efficiency.
--------
O(n) : Linear time. as elements increase operations time increases. 
Big o depends on the numbers of inputs(n) linearaly. 

Big O doesnt measure time, but how quicky the run time grows. change in run time. 
----------

O(1) : Constant time, flat line. 
Inputs can be any type of data. 

Irrespective of inputs, the number of operations is same.  
Not necessarily 1 operation but constant time.
