sequential in memory.
also due to has a smallest footprint on the memory. 

Operations
    lookup/access O(1)
    push/add o1
    insert O n 
    delete o n 

two types of arrays
    static and dynamic
    static, fixed in size. 
        define size at the beginning of time. 
        cant add later
    dynamic unfixed size. 
        when more needed, the items copied to a new location that fits all items.
        python and js has dynamic.  
        adding/appending to can be O(n)
