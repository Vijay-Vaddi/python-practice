AI as a large section, 
machine learning is to automate that ai with data
Deep learning is specific section of that ML. 
Data science is a bit of all which involves analyzing/getting something out of data. 

models are nothing but functions that perform certain actions on data to get a particular output. 


Steps of machine learning
Import data
clean the data
split the data. Training/test Set 
creat a model using a known algorithm. 
check the output
Improve the model, (with diff algo, diff/change data set etc)

(big companies rather give out models than data)

Tools for ML
Numpy : must 
lists and arrays, multi Dimension arrays which are used very often in ML
pandas : used for data analysis, idea of data frame, which allows func to manipulate data in tabular, rows and colums.
read csv, extract into data frames, then can do transformations and aggregations. 

scikit learn : used to create the model. import llibs and got diff algorithms

matplotlib : charting library. visualize data. 

jupyter notebooks. used for ML and datascience. 
allows to step through code, output and keep track of thigns, see and visualize.
allows to communicate better. standard in ML and DS.
